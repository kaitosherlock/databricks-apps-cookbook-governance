# 📖 Databricks Apps Cookbook 🍳 + Unity Catalog Governance

> **This is a fork.** It extends the upstream [databricks-apps-cookbook](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/databricks-apps-cookbook) (commit `88a0387`) with a Unity Catalog governance extension.
>
> - **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** — deploy this repo to Databricks Apps.
> - **[governance-app/README.md](governance-app/README.md)** — what the governance extension does, required UC privileges, and its limits (Vietnamese).
> - **[README_GOVERNANCE_VI.md](README_GOVERNANCE_VI.md)** — full governance notes (Vietnamese).
>
> Two deployable source roots: `streamlit/` (all Cookbook recipes **plus** the Governance menu) and `governance-app/` (governance only, fewer dependencies). Everything below is the upstream README.
